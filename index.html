		<h3>In the summer of 1943, the military glory of Alexei Maresyev spread. At the meeting, Boris Polevoy, a reporter for Pravda magazine, wrote down his story in a notebook. Three years later, the correspondent returned to the idea of creating a work about the feat of a legless pilot. The book was called "The Tale of a Real Man."</h3>
		<h3>This book tells us about the fate of a pilot who survived the crash of his plane. He crawled for more than 100 km to his side. During this "hike" he lived in harsh conditions: he slept in the open air, ate hedgehogs, and so on. He was transferred to the hospital in the village. After that, he showed what he was capable of and was able to fly an airplane without a leg, becoming a pilot</h3>
